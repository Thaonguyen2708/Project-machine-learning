Credit score classification for Bank
\\•	Framework: numpy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib 
\\•	Describe: Built a machine learning model to classify customers into credit risk groups based on a real-world dataset. Conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature selection to prepare the dataset. Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to improve prediction accuracy. Visualized data distributions and model performance using Seaborn and Matplotlib. This project highlights practical experience in predictive modeling, data preprocessing, and credit risk analysis
